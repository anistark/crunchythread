**CrunchyThread** is a Chrome extension that connects anime episodes directly to their respective **Reddit discussion threads** — instantly.

Currently supports **Crunchyroll**, with modular detectors for other streaming platforms coming soon. When you watch an anime episode, CrunchyThread automatically detects the title and episode number, then finds the **matching Reddit discussion thread** (in the anime's subreddit). Shows the thread title, subreddit, and comment stats (upvotes/comments/time) and links directly to the Reddit thread.

As anime fans, we love the shared experience — the memes, theories, and emotional breakdowns — that follow every episode drop.

But right now, you have to:
1. Watch an episode
2. Open Reddit
3. Manually search for the right thread

**CrunchyThread** makes this frictionless.
It's your one-click bridge from *watching* to *talking*.

## 📥 Installation

### From Chrome Web Store
1. Visit [CrunchyThread on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/crunchythread/faghgokfpnffhpknonlghbogjkaafnil)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Confirm permissions

### Manual Installation (Developer Version)
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/anistark/crunchythread/releases)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
5. Click "Load unpacked"
6. Select the extracted folder

## 🔌 Extensible Detector Architecture

CrunchyThread uses a modular detector system that makes it easy to add support for new streaming platforms:

### Current Support
- ✅ **Crunchyroll** - Fully supported with multi-layer detection
- ✅ **Generic Fallback** - Works on any website using common meta tags and patterns

### Planned Support (TODO)
- 🔜 **Netflix** - Coming soon
- 🔜 **Hulu** - Coming soon
- 🔜 **Prime Video** - Coming soon
- 🔜 **Disney Hotstar** - Coming soon

### Architecture
Each streaming service has a dedicated detector under `src/content/detectors/services/`. The system automatically selects the right detector based on the current domain, falling back to a generic detector for unsupported platforms.

### Adding a New Detector
To add support for a new streaming service:

1. Create a new detector file: `src/content/detectors/services/[service-name].ts`
2. Extend the `BaseDetector` class from `src/content/detectors/base.ts`
3. Implement the `detect()` method to extract anime title and episode number
4. Register the detector in `src/content/detectors/index.ts`

See the **Crunchyroll detector** for a complete example.
