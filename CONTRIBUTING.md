## 🎯 Common Contribution Types

### Adding Anime to Database

The easiest way to contribute! Help us grow the anime database.

1. **Edit the mapping file**
   ```
   data/ANIMESUBREDDITS.yaml
   ```

2. **Add your anime** (keep alphabetical order)
   ```yaml
   - title: "Attack on Titan"
     subreddits: ["attackontitan"]
     aliases: ["AOT", "Shingeki no Kyojin"]
     season_specific: false
   ```

3. **Rebuild the extension**
   ```sh
   just build
   ```
   This auto-generates the TypeScript from your YAML changes.

4. **Test locally**
   - Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
   - Open a Crunchyroll episode page to test

5. **Submit PR**
   - Clear title: "Add Attack on Titan to anime database"
   - Only modify `data/ANIMESUBREDDITS.yaml` in this PR

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check if bug is already reported**
   - Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/anistark/crunchythread/issues)

2. **Create a detailed bug report**
   ```md
   ## Description
   Brief description of the bug

   ## Steps to Reproduce
   1. Open Crunchyroll
   2. Click extension icon
   3. See error

   (if applicable)
   ```

3. **Provide context**
   - Is this consistent or random?
   - Does it happen in developer mode?
   - What anime did you test with?

### Proposing Features

1. **Start a discussion** instead of opening an issue
   - Go to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/anistark/crunchythread/discussions)
   - Create a "Feature Request"

2. **Describe your feature**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How would users interact with it?
   - Any design mockups?

3. **Get feedback**
   - Maintainers will discuss feasibility
   - Refine the feature together
   - Open PR when ready


## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing

**Step 1: Build the extension**
```sh
just build
```

**Step 2: Load extension in Chrome**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist/` folder from this project

**Step 3: Test on Crunchyroll**
1. Go to any Crunchyroll anime episode page (e.g., https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/...)
2. Click the CrunchyThread extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. The popup should:
   - Show "Currently watching: [Anime Title]" if detection works
   - Show "Episode [number]" if episode was detected
   - Display "Discussion Threads:" with Reddit results if search works
4. Check the browser console (F12 → Console tab) for CrunchyThread debug logs

**Step 4: Enable debug logs (optional)**
Debug logging is **commented out** by default but easy to enable for development:
1. Open `src/popup/App.tsx`, `src/content/crunchyroll-detector.ts`, or `src/background/service-worker.ts`
2. Uncomment the `debugLog()`, `debugWarn()`, and `debugError()` function calls throughout the file
3. Rebuild: `pnpm build`

**Step 5: Check debug logs**
If the extension isn't working:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for logs starting with `[🧵 CrunchyThread]`
4. These will show:
   - Whether content script loaded
   - What anime data was detected
   - Whether message communication succeeded
   - Reddit search results and scoring

**Step 6: Test Reddit search**
1. Check background service worker logs:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find CrunchyThread
   - Click "service worker" link
   - Check console for search results

**Note:** Hard refresh Chrome after making code changes to ensure new build is loaded.

### Code Quality Checks
```sh
# Individual checks
pnpm lint          # ESLint
pnpm format:check  # Prettier
pnpm type-check    # TypeScript
```

### Testing Across Browsers/Regions
- Test on Crunchyroll US, EU (if available)
- Test with different anime
- Test on different episode pages
