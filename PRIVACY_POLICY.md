# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 7, 2025

## Overview

CrunchyThread ("we," "us," "our," or "the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.

## What Information We Collect

### Information We Collect
- **Current Page URL and Title**: When you visit a Crunchyroll page, our content script reads the page URL and title to extract the anime title and episode number
- **Your Anime Viewing Activity**: We process this information to identify which anime and episode you're currently watching

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do not store any browsing history beyond the current page
- We do not collect personally identifiable information (names, emails, addresses)
- We do not track your viewing habits over time
- We do not collect health, financial, or authentication information
- We do not access your Reddit account or credentials
- We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or telemetry
- We do not monitor clicks, keystrokes, or other user activity

## How We Use Information

The information we collect is used **solely** for the following purposes:
1. Detecting which anime and episode you're currently watching on Crunchyroll
2. Matching this information to the appropriate Reddit discussion thread
3. Displaying the matching discussion thread in our extension popup

## Where Information is Processed

All processing happens **locally on your device**:
- Your browser reads the page information
- Data is matched against our local anime-to-subreddit database
- Results are displayed immediately without external transmission

## Third-Party Services

### Reddit API
CrunchyThread uses Reddit's public API to search for discussion threads. When we search for threads:
- We send the anime title and episode number to Reddit's public search API
- We do not send any personal information about you
- Reddit's Privacy Policy applies to their handling of data: https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy

**Important**: You are not authenticated through this extension. We access only public, previously published discussion threads.

### Crunchyroll
CrunchyThread reads information displayed on publicly visible Crunchyroll pages. We do not transmit any information to Crunchyroll. Your Crunchyroll account information is not accessed or shared.

## Data Retention

- We do not permanently store your viewing history
- We do not create user profiles
- We do not retain search queries
- Our local database only contains anime-to-subreddit mappings, which is publicly maintained

## Your Rights

- **Disable the Extension**: You can disable or uninstall CrunchyThread at any time
- **Clear Extension Data**: Chrome allows you to clear extension data in your privacy settings
- **No Account Required**: We do not create accounts or require login, so there's no user data tied to an identity

## Compliance

CrunchyThread complies with:
- Chrome Web Store's data usage policies
- Reddit's Terms of Service and API usage guidelines (public API access only)
- Crunchyroll's Terms of Service (we do not bypass authentication or access restricted content)

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the extension constitutes acceptance of updated terms.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please:
- Open an issue on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/anistark/crunchythread/issues
- Include "Privacy" in the issue title

## Summary

**In short**: CrunchyThread only reads what anime you're watching, finds the Reddit discussion thread for it, and shows you the link. Nothing is stored. Nothing is tracked. Your privacy is our priority.
